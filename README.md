# SocialMediaAnalytics - PLACEOLDER

<b>Introduction: </b> This is a social media independent study project that I undertook to gain more experience with social media (Reddit) data text mining and topic modeling. The overaching goal of this project is to analyze data from comparable subreddits to ascertain whether the subcribers to these subreddits discuss similar topics.

* <b>For version 1 of this project (the original scope)</b>, I extracted data from three subreddits - Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. These are three Tier 1 metropolitan cities in India and their subreddits have roughly the same number of subscribers. My initial (naive?) hypothesis was that the subscribers to these subreddits may belong to similar socio/economic and education backgrounds (in aggregate), and as such, may be discussing similar concerns or interests ("topics"). Even if they are not discussing similar topics, it may still be interesting to understand city specific discussion topics. <FINDINGS>
  
* <b>For version 2</b>, I worked with subreddits where subscribers could be reasonably expected to predominantly converse in English. I compared Boston, Chicago and New York City subreddits



to these subto check potentially, and where the subreddits have approximately  and use natural language processing/topic modeling techniques to extract popular topics that may be discussed within the sub credits and detemin
  

This is proj aims is to compare discussions on three sub Reddit for major cities in India to assess whether these groups discuss similar topics.

<b>Technologies</b>: This is a python based project that predominantly uses the following libraries: 
- eda and visualization - numpy/pandas, matplotlib/seaborn;
- text processing - nltk, spacy; and
- topic modeling - sklearn and gensim
