# PLACEHOLDER - Subreddit Text Analysis and Topic Modeling

<b>Introduction: </b> This is a social media independent study project that I undertook to gain more experience with social media (Reddit) data text mining and topic modeling. The overaching goal of this project is to analyze data from comparable subreddits to ascertain whether the subcribers to these subreddits discuss similar topics.

* <b>For version 1 of this project (the original scope)</b>, I extracted data from three subreddits - Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. These are three Tier 1 metropolitan cities in India and their subreddits have roughly the same number of subscribers. My initial (naive?) hypothesis was that the subscribers to these subreddits may belong to similar socio/economic and education backgrounds (in aggregate), and as such, may be discussing similar concerns or interests ("topics"). Even if they are not discussing similar topics, it may still be interesting to understand city specific discussion topics.

  DISCUSS
  - challenges with social media text processing
  - word/topic visual
  
* <b>For version 2</b>, I worked with subreddits where subscribers could be reasonably expected to predominantly converse in English. I compared Boston, Chicago and New York City subreddits
  SAME DISCUSSION POINTS


<b>Technologies</b>: This is a python based project that predominantly uses the following libraries: 
- eda and visualization - numpy/pandas, matplotlib/seaborn;
- text processing - nltk, spacy; and
- topic modeling - sklearn and gensim
